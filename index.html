        Natural Gas Shortage Complaints in China
      </h1>
      <p class="subtitle">
      </p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>Number of complaints about natural gas shortages since January 1, 2022, published on People's Daily Message Board for Leaders section where citizens could post their suggestions and complaints to the government.</p>
        <p>By searching posts containing keywords "gas shortages", more than 1,000 articles were shown on People's Daily website. Because of the website restriction, records before Jan 1, 2022 were not available.</p>
        
        <p>Most of the complaints were published in mid-to-late December 2022, and complaints decreased significantly in Januray and most complaints were marked "solved" before mid-January when people were about to enjoy the Lunar New Year.</p>

        <p class="subtitle">Where are all those complaints?
        </p>
        <p>Since 2017, provinces near Beijing have started to abandon coal-powered heating and turned to natural gas in an effort to reduce smog and protect envrironment during winter in northern China. But there have been constant complaints after since, mainly due to poor construction gas pipe quality and insufficient supply of natural gas, especially during times when the price of coal is high and local governments were unable to subsidize the heating companies.</p>

        <!-- <p>Hebei, the province surrounding Beijing becomes the major province that has transformed power from coal to natural gas.</p> -->

        </script>

        <p>Among all the complaints, more than 90 percent of them have been solved or resolved, and only 7 percent of them have not been replied by local government. The average time for local authorities to respond to a complaint is more than 21 days.</p>

        <p>Generally, northern provinces solve these complaints quicker than southern provinces.</p>

        <p>Guangxi and Guizhou in southern China are among the provinces where local authorities spent longest times to respond to online complaints, which took 70 and 33 days respectively.</p>
