# Where are people complaining natural gas shortages in winter?
As people in the north semiosphere endure the winter, some may not have the heating due to natual gas shortages. Many places in northern China have turned from coal-powered heating to natural gas heating, but due to poor construction quality and natural gas shortages, many people have to live in cold. The project collected data from the [Message Board for Leaders](https://liuyan.people.com.cn/) section of Chinese state media People's Daily.
